Note by the creator:
I use english as everyday languange to interact with some people i also use some indonesian languange. my apologies if some of that makes the readers confused.
this is the first readme file that i've created. a little fun fact: people usually calls me Hiko around the internet and it is Hikolai for short. 
i've been very busy lately so i had to do this minutes before deadline, i hope this will not decrease the success rate to pass the next stage. i am really hoping that i could win to bring the good names of my school and class.

sincerely, Byan
